# Video Slicer

This Python script takes an input of a video file, and returns a new directory in the same folder structure that contains extrated frame images. The number of images (in FPS) can be changed in the py code.

## Installation

Not required. Ensure all dependancies are present, and the script can be run from an IDE or command line with parameters. Copy the slicer into a folder with the video you wish to slice, update the paths in the script and run the script.
